# Changelog

All notable changes to the Comfortzone Heat Pump integration are documented here.
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.12.0] – 2026-08-13

### Added — fan speed control (låg / normal / boost / schemalagd)
The Comfortzone Android app can change the fan speed, so the capability
exists on the Loggamera side even though it appears in none of the public
API documentation. This release adds it.

- **New `select.comfortzone_fan_speed`** with four modes — **Låg**,
  **Normal**, **Boost** and **Schemalagd (automatik)** — matching the app.
  Scheduled mode makes the fan follow the reduced-fan day/night schedule
  already surfaced by the `reduced_fan_*_schedule` diagnostic sensors,
  rather than holding a fixed speed.
- **Value mapping** taken from the reverse-engineered control protocol
  ([qix67/comfortzone_heatpump](https://github.com/qix67/comfortzone_heatpump)):
  `1 = low, 2 = normal, 3 = fast, 4 = on timer`. Mode 4 only exists on
  pumps running control protocol 1.8 or later; on an older 1.6 pump the
  write is rejected and the integration hides the option automatically.
- **Automatic property-name discovery.** Loggamera publishes no list of
  writable properties, so the first write probes a short list of likely
  `SetProperty` names (`SetFanSpeed`, `SetFanMode`, `SetVentilation`, …)
  and remembers whichever the API accepts. Wrong guesses are rejected by
  the API without reaching the pump.
- **New `fan_speed_property` option** to pin an exact property name if your
  pump answers to something outside the candidate list.
- **New `scripts/probe_loggamera_properties.py`** — a dependency-free
  script that dumps every field your pump reports and, with
  `--probe-write`, identifies the property name that writes the fan speed.
  By default it re-writes the mode the pump is already in, so a successful
  probe changes nothing.
- **Diagnostics** now report which read field and write property were
  resolved, so a diagnostics dump is enough to confirm the mapping.

### Changed
- `async_set_property` accepts an `attempts` override. Probing uses a
  single attempt so a rejected name fails fast instead of waiting out the
  60-second retry; ordinary writes keep the existing retry behaviour.

## [2.11.0] – 2026-06-05

### Changed — hot-water draw detection rebuilt and renamed
A full day of labelled real-world data (two confirmed showers, several
non-shower draws) showed the old `shower_in_progress` sensor was built on
a false premise: **tank temperature can't tell a shower from a bath or a
big dishwashing run**, and in practice the *largest* tank drops were not
showers while the actual showers left almost no trace. The detector is
rebuilt around what the data actually supports.

- **Renamed** `binary_sensor.comfortzone_shower_in_progress` →
  `binary_sensor.comfortzone_large_hot_water_draw`. The entity ID changes
  (the old one is dropped); update any automations that referenced it. The
  rename is deliberate honesty about what the sensor can know.
- **New "missing heat" accumulator model.** Each poll integrates how far
  the tank falls short of where the pump's current mode says it should be.
  The sensor turns on once the accumulated shortfall passes a configurable
  threshold and off once the tank recovers (hysteresis). This replaces the
  brittle instantaneous-slope + fixed-drop logic.
- **Recalibrated expected production slope** from 0.40 → **0.15 °C/min**.
  The old value was almost 3× the real RX95 rate (measured across five
  cycles), which made every production cycle look like a draw — the root
  cause of the constant false positives at cycle start.
- **Artifact rejection.** When the pump switches to hot-water mode the
  `Hot water temp` reading can plunge tens of degrees in minutes because
  the exchange valve repoints the sensor onto the cold loop (the same
  directional effect behind the old −30 °C heating ΔT). Drops faster than
  1.0 °C/min are now treated as sensor artifacts and excluded — this stops
  a 28 °C "phantom drop" from being read as a giant draw.
- **Configurable sensitivity** via the options flow
  (`large_draw_threshold_c`, default 3 °C of accumulated shortfall).

### Added
- **Hot water cycle duration sensor** (`hot_water_cycle_duration`,
  diagnostic). Reports the length in minutes of the last completed
  hot-water production cycle, with a rolling-median baseline and an
  `unusually_long` attribute. This is the cycle-length heuristic for
  catching the one case the draw sensor is blind to: a shower taken while
  the pump is *already* producing into a still-hot tank leaves no mark on
  the tank temperature, but it does force the pump to run longer to refill.
  The "unusually long" floor is configurable (`long_hw_cycle_min`,
  default 50 min).

## [2.10.0] – 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Addition heater energy sensor** (`addition_heater_energy`). Cumulative
  kWh integrated from the `Addition effect` reading, with
  `state_class: total_increasing` so the Home Assistant Energy panel
  picks it up directly. Lets you track exactly how much COP-1 backup
  electricity has been used over time and place it in the Energy panel
  as an "Individual device" entry. Pairs naturally with the existing
  `addition_heater_runtime` (hours) and `addition_heater_active`
  (problem alarm) sensors.

## [2.9.0] – 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **HACS dashboard icon** — `hacs.json` now declares an `icon` URL so
  HACS can render the integration's logo in the dashboard listing
  instead of a blank tile. The HA device-page icon was already served
  from `brand/icon.png` via HA 2026.3+'s local brand mechanism.
- **Shower detection rewritten to be mode-aware.** The previous logic
  suppressed detection completely while the pump was producing hot
  water and used a single fixed slope threshold. Real-world data showed
  this missed obvious draws (e.g. a 14 °C tank drop over 45 minutes
  that never triggered). The new detector compares the **actual** tank
  slope against the **expected** slope given the pump's current
  activity:
  - Idle / heating: expected ~−0.05 °C/min (standing losses)
  - Making hot water: expected ~+0.40 °C/min (active production)
  An alarm fires when the actual slope falls more than 0.20 °C/min
  below expected AND the tank has actually dropped ≥ 0.5 °C in the
  rolling 5-minute window. This catches showers during HW production
  (when the tank is being recharged) and ignores transient sensor
  blips. The trailing on-window is also bumped from 90 s to 120 s.
- Sensor attributes now expose `actual slope`, `expected slope`,
  `deviation`, `absolute drop` and `pump_making_hot_water` so it's
  easy to see exactly why the alarm did or didn't fire.

## [2.8.0] – 2026-05-18

### Changed — electrical-input estimation recalibrated
Real-world observations showed the per-mode power/energy/cost sensors
under-counting by ~0.4–0.7 kWh/h during sustained heat-pump operation
on cold nights. Root causes: the EN255 datasheet COP figures assume
ideal lab conditions (12 °C wet outdoor air), defrost cycles bypass the
thermal × factor pipeline entirely, and the controller's standby draw
was set too low. Three calibrations land in this release:

- **Cold-outdoor COP penalty.** The base spec-curve factor is now
  multiplied by `1 + 0.04 × (12 − outdoor_°C)` (capped at +60 %) when
  the air is colder than the EN255 reference temperature. At
  −5 °C outside this raises the estimate by ~68 %; at +12 °C or warmer
  it is a no-op. Override factor still bypasses this when set.
- **Defrost flat estimate.** When the pump enters a defrost cycle
  (compressor running, both exchange valves closed) the integration
  now reports a flat 1500 W electrical estimate instead of using the
  near-zero thermal reading.
- **Standby bumped from 15 W to 25 W** to better match real-world
  controller + PCB + sensor draw on RX95.

Six new pytest cases cover the new behaviour (47 total, all green).

## [2.7.0] – 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Compressor running-at-max binary sensor**
  (`compressor_running_at_max`). Trips when inverter load has been
  continuously at or above the configured threshold for the configured
  duration. Useful as a clean automation trigger for "pump is out of
  headroom" reasoning — e.g. accept that indoor target won't be
  reached, defer DHW production, or ease the heat curve so the pump
  isn't forced into the resistive backup. Defaults: 90 % for 5 min;
  both configurable via the options flow.

## [2.6.0] – 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Configurable alarm thresholds.** All four alarm sensors gained
  options-flow controls:
  - `short_cycle_threshold` — starts per hour (default 6)
  - `addition_power_threshold_w` (default 500 W) and
    `addition_duration_threshold_s` (default 600 s, i.e. 10 min)
  - `filter_warning_days` (default 7)
  - `low_hw_threshold_c` (default 40 °C) and
    `low_hw_hysteresis_c` (default 3 °C; alarm clears at threshold +
    hysteresis)
- **Addition heater runtime sensor** (`addition_heater_runtime`).
  Cumulative hours the resistive backup has been drawing >100 W.
  Lets you spot how much expensive COP-1 electricity has slipped past
  the heat pump and informs whether settings need adjusting.
- **DHW production rate sensor** (`dhw_production_rate`). Thermal kW
  averaged over a 5-minute window during HW production. Drops over
  time at constant compressor load are an early sign of fouling /
  limescale on the tank coil. Disabled by default.
- **Tank heating rate sensor** (`tank_heating_rate`). Mirror image
  of `tank_decay_rate` — °C per hour while the tank is being charged.
  Disabled by default.
- **Compressor load percentage sensor** (`compressor_load_percentage`).
  `frequency / freq_max × 100`. Lets a controller know whether the
  compressor still has headroom or is already pinned at 100 %.

## [2.5.0] – 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- `heating_circuit_delta_t` no longer reports nonsense (e.g. -30 °C)
  while the pump is producing hot water or idling. The sensor now
  updates **only during heating mode** and holds the last meaningful
  reading otherwise — values land in the expected 0–7 °C band.

### Added
- **Hot water loop ΔT** sensor (`hot_water_loop_delta_t`). Mirror of
  the heating ΔT sensor for DHW production: shows the absolute
  temperature differential the heat exchanger lifts in a single pass
  (~25–40 °C is healthy on RX95).
- **Compressor short-cycling alarm** (`compressor_short_cycling`,
  PROBLEM device class). Trips when the compressor starts more than
  6 times in the last hour — typically means undersized emitters,
  hysteresis tuning, or refrigerant-charge issues.
- **Addition heater active alarm** (`addition_heater_active`). Trips
  when the resistive elpatron has been drawing >500 W for more than
  10 minutes. Aligned with the goal of avoiding COP-1 backup heat.
- **Filter change soon warning** (`filter_change_due_soon`). Soft
  warning when fewer than 7 days remain on the filter timer.
- **Low hot water warning** (`low_hot_water`). Trips at <40 °C tank
  temperature, clears at >43 °C (hysteresis). Useful trigger for
  "load DHW now if price is below average" automations.

## [2.4.0] – 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Per-model COP curves.** The thermal-to-electrical conversion factor is
  now looked up per pump model in `MODEL_COP_CURVES`. Selecting `RX95` uses
  its EN255 datasheet curve (factor 0.235 at 35°C flow → 0.314 at 50°C
  flow); other models fall back to a generic 0.30 factor that the user can
  refine via the override option. Adding support for a new model is now a
  single dict entry — no helper-function changes required.
- Three additional pytest cases covering the per-model lookup and the
  generic fallback (41 cases total, all green).

### Changed
- `compressor_factor_from_flow()` and `compute_compressor_electrical_w()`
  now take an explicit `model` parameter (defaults to `RX95`). The
  `OptimisticConfirmedMixin` exposes the configured model so every
  computed sensor automatically uses the right curve for the configured
  pump.
- README and option help texts clarify that the spec-curve numbers are
  RX95-specific and that other models use a generic fallback until their
  datasheet values are added.

## [2.3.0] – 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Optimistic-until-confirmed reads after writes.** New
  `OptimisticConfirmedMixin` keeps the entity showing the user-written
  value (`SetIndoorTemp`, `SetHotWaterTemp`, `SetHeatCurve`,
  `SetHotWaterExtraEnabled`, `SetHolidayReductionDays`) until the
  Loggamera API actually confirms it on a follow-up poll, with a 90 s
  timeout safety net. Eliminates UI flicker when the API hasn't caught
  up to a fresh write at the next coordinator refresh.
- **Float-tolerant boolean helper** (`is_truthy`) that treats `"1"`,
  `"1.0"`, `"true"`, `"YES"`, `"on"` and similar variants identically.
  Used by the mode predicates and switches.
- New `calculations.py` module exposing the pure derivation helpers
  (spec curve, RawData parsing, mode predicates). Independently
  importable and unit-testable without Home Assistant installed.

### Changed
- **Faster post-write feedback.** First refresh after a successful set
  drops from 20 s to **5 s**, with a follow-up at 15 s as a safety net.
  Combined with the optimistic mixin, the user sees their setting take
  effect almost immediately without flicker.
- **Float-tolerant numeric parsing** across sensor / number / switch /
  binary_sensor / climate. The Loggamera API may report integer-looking
  values as `"70"` or `"70.0"` interchangeably depending on the field;
  the integration now accepts both.
- `api.py` and `computed_sensors.py` now import their helpers from
  `calculations.py`. The existing
  `from .api import find_value_from_raw_data` continues to work via a
  re-export, so any external code keeps compiling.
- README clarified: the "Price reports öre/kWh" toggle is **off by
  default** because the modern, official Nord Pool integration in HA
  already reports `SEK/kWh`. Only enable it for legacy template-based
  Nord Pool sensors that still emit öre.

### Internal
- 38 pytest cases (kept locally — `tests/` is now gitignored to keep
  the HACS package lean) covering the spec-based COP curve, mode
  predicates with float-shaped booleans, and the API client's
  retry / spacing / concurrency guarantees.

## [2.2.0] – 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Spec-based COP curve** for compressor electrical estimation. The factor
  now interpolates linearly between the EN255 datasheet anchor points
  (`0.235` at 35°C flow → `0.314` at 50°C flow) so estimates track the
  pump's real performance under different operating conditions. Users can
  still override with a fixed factor in options (set to 0 to keep the
  spec curve, default).
- **Defrost detection** — `defrost_cycle_count` and `last_defrost_duration`
  use a heuristic ("compressor active but neither valve open") and report
  their result when the next-cycle resolution lands.
- **Compressor cycle counter** for wear/short-cycling diagnostics.
- **Per-mode runtime sensors** (`heating_runtime`, `hot_water_runtime`)
  reporting cumulative hours.
- **Heating circuit ΔT** sensor (flow − return) for diagnosing
  circulation-flow problems.
- **Tank decay rate** sensor (`tank_decay_rate`) measuring °C/h drop in the
  tank while the pump is not producing hot water.
- **Specific heating energy** sensor (`specific_heating_energy`) — moving
  average of kWh required per °C indoor temperature rise.
- **Reduced fan schedule** diagnostic sensors for weekday and weekend
  quiet-mode windows.
- **Shower-in-progress** binary sensor — heuristic detection from a fast
  drop in tank temperature while no production is happening.
- **Pump activity status** now reports `Defrosting` when both valves are
  closed mid-compressor-run.
- **Price entity at install** — the initial setup now offers a
  `sensor`-domain entity selector for a Nord Pool / electricity price
  sensor, making per-mode cost tracking work out of the box.

### Changed
- `instant_cop` is **enabled by default**. Reports unavailable when the
  estimated electrical input is below 100 W to avoid noise near idle.
- Default for `price_in_ore` changed to **off**. The modern Nord Pool
  integration reports SEK/kWh natively; the toggle is only useful for
  legacy setups.
- Compressor electrical factor option's default is now `0` (= use spec
  curve). The previous `0.4` constant remains available as an override.

## [2.1.0] – 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Pump activity status** sensor (`pump_activity_status`) – reports `Heating` /
  `Making Hot Water` / `Idle` based on compressor and valve state.
- **Estimated total power consumption** sensor (`estimated_total_power`) –
  combined electrical W from compressor (thermal-to-electrical conversion),
  resistive addition heater, circulation pump, fan and standby load.
- **Estimated aux power consumption** sensor (`estimated_aux_power`) – fan +
  standby only; disabled by default.
- **Per-mode power sensors** – `heating_power` and `hot_water_power`. Reports
  the live electrical draw while the pump is dedicated to that mode.
- **Per-mode energy sensors** – `heating_energy`, `hot_water_energy` and
  `total_energy`. Cumulative kWh with `total_increasing` state class so they
  drop straight into the Home Assistant Energy panel.
- **Per-mode cost sensors** – `heating_cost` and `hot_water_cost`. Cumulative
  cost in your HA-configured currency, computed from a user-supplied Nord Pool
  (or other) electricity-price entity. Disabled by default.
- **Instant COP** sensor (`instant_cop`) – live thermal-output / electrical-in
  ratio. Disabled by default.
- **Options flow:** new fields for *electricity price entity*, *price in
  öre/kWh*, and *compressor electrical factor*.
- Translations for all new options strings (English + Swedish).

### Changed
- README updated with Energy-panel guidance and computed-sensor reference.
- Bumped manifest version to 2.1.0.

### Security
- Rewrote git history to scrub a development device-id that had appeared in
  earlier README revisions. Replaced with a generic placeholder.

## [2.0.0]

Initial HACS-compliant release with full RX95 entity coverage, options flow
for the model selector, diagnostics, branded device card and Swedish
translation.
